    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Galactic Getaways began as a dream among a group of visionaries who were captivated by the stars, driven by the desire to make the wonders of space accessible to all.
      Founded in 2050, at the dawn of commercial space travel, Galactic Getaways quickly grew from a small startup to the industry leader in space tourism, pushing the boundaries of human exploration.
      Our first voyage to the Moon sparked a global fascination, as we transported the first-ever group of civilian explorers to walk on its dusty surface, marveling at Earthrise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then, we’ve expanded our horizons, offering journeys to Mars, the Asteroid Belt, and even exploratory flybys of Jupiter’s icy moons. Every voyage is designed not just as a vacation, but as an opportunity to rediscover our place in the cosmos.
      Our pioneering spirit, rooted in the belief that space belongs to everyone, has fueled our mission to make the impossible possible—bringing adventure seekers to the final frontier and beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, Galactic Getaways is a symbol of innovation and excitement. With a fleet of cutting-edge spacecraft and a team of seasoned astronauts, our adventures redefine luxury travel, delivering an experience that blends the thrill of discovery with the comforts of home, all under the stars.
